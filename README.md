# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, hosted at [aakashbaheti.github.io](https://aakashbaheti.github.io/). This site is a comprehensive showcase of my journey as a Data Engineering Intern at T-Mobile and a student at the University of Washington, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Informatics with a focus on Data Science. The website features several key components, including an **About Me** section detailing my academic and professional background, a **Projects** section highlighting work like face recognition software developed in Python, and a **Skills** section demonstrating my proficiency in technologies such as SQL, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is designed to be fully responsive, with modern styling powered by CSS and SCSS, and interactivity enhanced through JavaScript. It provides an intuitive and engaging user experience while offering an easy way to explore my journey and connect with me. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work!
